       " 'dear local newspaper , <caps> i have found that many experts say that computers do not benifit our society . in some cases this is true but in most cases studdies show that computers can help people . while nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e-mail . <percent> of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for reasearch or to help find good books . also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide . <caps> people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist . <person> said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write , talk , or write back for much cheaper ! almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e-mail <caps> a student ever needs homework because lam out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e-mail . even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people . the president of the post office , <person> said <caps> would be imposible to get mail to our coustmers <caps> <caps> were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is . <caps> that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist <caps> <caps> were not for the moder communication abilities that computer provid us . because information can be commucated so quick . so can reasearch . when the country of <location> took a pole <percent> of people used computer for any type of reasearch , of those <percent> were students currently in school and <percent> of them have good grades . when the same survey was taken in the <location> <percent> of people used computers fore reasons and <percent> were students who had good grade <caps> <caps> were not posible for me to access documents in the <caps> <caps> online i probably would not have gotten an a+ on my <caps> assignment ! could you amagine <caps> suddenly your newspaper reporters couldnt use the internet to work on their reports ? the articles would probably be <num> after the events occur . most buissness , including the newspaper , use the internet to advertise , shop , or read . the association of <organization> reported that in <percent> of <organization> used a website and of them <percent> were in good positions . the president of <caps> <num> imports said that they use an online catalouge because <caps> is cheaper , but they can also promote that <caps> is to save trees , or for the castomers convinence . small <organization> can make websites to promote them selves and explain their star to potential coustomers . <person> , the owner of <organization> said that the internet saved her resturant . <caps> <caps> wer not for the internet <num> more people would be jobless in <location> . in conclusion computer help everyday people and without them most convinences would not exist . they help communicate around the world . computers help people reaserch subjects for school reports , and they make the current economy get better everyday . in moderation computers are the most useful tool out there .\\n',\n",
       " 'dear <location> , i know having computers has a positive effect on people . the computers connect families , contain information which is great for peoples education , and are very conveint . computors are a step into the future and we should take advantage of it . first off the internet or e-mail will help family members connect . my family , which lives <num> hours away by car , love to talk with me by e-mail . this helps me connect with my family and is just another reason why we should have computors . another reason that includes family is when the family is just sitting around and are calling everywhere just to find a board game , it would just be easier to go online to find it . this way it would be quick and easy to find that one board game . the last reason why a computer would help a family is if a family wants to get in to any kinds of activities and they need the number they could just go online . on the internet the family could find the numbers , the and some information about it . this way more and more families can do activities together . as one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together . an other reason why the computers are good for society is educations . with information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn . now a days people try to find the out , but will all the tools on the computers mae people get the education . secondly computers are another way to go to collage . if you arnt up to going to school/collage because your sick . you wouldnt have to miss anything because with a click of a button you will have the materials needed for what was missed . lastly everyone knows that in <location> most classrooms cant afford one computer . the children want computors so hard . if they were to get one it would change so much . they would be able to learn so much more than before . the children could lean about different countries far away . as a result computers would improve the way we learn . the last reason why computers are so helpful is convience . now a say the world is crazy , so if we dont have to go out or talk to someone we wont . the computer will offer the ability to confrence will other people so that there would be communication between work parttners . with the ability to talk with another for work would make us a lighter nation . this is only one of the many reasons computers are very conviente , subssiquently computers are conviente because you could book flights , vacations , rentals , and much more . with a click of a button you should be going to <caps> or a nice vacation .\\n',\n",

       " 'did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety , natural education , and their social life ? in my opinion , the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society . initially , ones safety while using a computer is at risk . to begin , when someone is talking to another on a computer , they <month> never know who is at the other end of it . for example , <caps> a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her , it could be a predator . she will never know unless they meet us somewhere . at this point , it maybe too late . moreover , studies show that <percent> of peoples information is more widely exposed in the last <num> years due to the new chat websites . such as myspace and facebook . in these websites , people share their information . with this , their safety is at risk . finally , people should stop using computers as much as they are now , in order to keep their safety safe . furthermore , enjoying nature is a must , in our world full of immense landscapes , wide waters , dense forests , and lush valleys . <caps> you depend on your computer to teach you about the world , you should cease this use . one must actually be outside , experiencing the feel , the smell , and even the taste of nature . a recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a <num> page essay on what they had learned . the people who didnt go and simply read information off their computer , could not write this much . finally , society needs to back away from their computers , and stop into . thirdly , a persons social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons . one reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends . sure , you can chat with people online , but thats nothing like chatting in person . there is no need to talk to a friend or family member online , when you could do it in person . finally , <caps> someone takes an embarrasing picture of you and puts it on their computer , it is there forever . thus , you can lose friends , whether youre the person in the picture or the addict who put the picture on . with this , you can easily ruin your family/social life by using your computer too often . how would you feel <caps> it was your fault that someones safety is at risk ? wouldnt you rather enjoy nature in person instead of which it on your computer and not get the fall effect ? couldnt you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer ? there are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society . i encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life .\\n',\n",
       " '<percent> of people agree that computers make life less complicated . i also agree with this . using computers teaches hand-eye coordination , gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people , and lets people talk online with other people . i think that these are all very important . why wouldnt you want to have strong hand-eye coordination ? i think this a very important skill . computers help teach hand-eye coordination and they keep it strong . while youre looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go . good hand-eye coordination is used for a lot of things; mostly everything . if you play some sports like baseball , hand-eye is one of the most important elements . why not make that stronger off of the feild ? also , hand-eye can be used to <organization> while taking notes . hand-eye is involved with almost everything you do . you cant have a poor hand-eye coordination or else you wont be able to function properly . <num> out of <num> doctors agree that hand-eye very important for healthy living . i love to travel , but i want to know about the place im going to before i get on the phone to go there . said <person> , a science teacher at <organization> . he feels the way , im sure , a lot of people feel . they want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current . the computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world . some books dont offer as much information or they need to be updated . computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions . no one wants to be ignorant right ? people want to know whats going on in the world quick and easy . the computer does this . i remember when i was about <num> , our phone broke in our house . we couldnt go out and get one right away either . the only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer . the computer made it easier to e-mail everyone and tell them why we werent answering our house phone . this happens more often than you think . people need to communicate through computer a lot . at work , if you need to talk to an employee or co-worker and you cant leave your desk , you can just e-mail the information to them . <num> out of <num> employees say that it is much faster and easier to e-mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person . a lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier . computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people . the most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people . you can make a difference in the way people feel about computers . write to your local newspaper . its now or never !\\n',\n",
       " 'dear reader , <organization> has had a dramatic effect on human life . it has changed the way we do almost everything today . the most well know , is the computer . this device has allowed people do buy things online , talk to people online , and also provides entertainment for some people . all good qualities that make everyones lives easier . imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice its almost empty . someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far . what do you do ? well you could go on a computer and look for food online . ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free ! the amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house . but food isnt all you can purchase . many products are sold through the computer . need new toys for kids ? or how about a new hat for your friend ? maybe even more curtains for your room ? well at the easy access of internet on a computer , you can buy all those items and more . the computer has also the way of communication . lets say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country . <caps> someone dosent own a phone or <caps> they cant make the call , all these is to be in you on the computer . you can communicate with anyone just by using your email adress . now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer . just type to want to say and boom , instant , on the chat . lets face it . no matter what a child or even teenager . but now with a computer all that can change . with just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home . but what <caps> you dont want a movie ? no entertainment like listing to musics , watching fun , and probable the most popular playing games . everyone loves to play a game every once in a while , and with the selection of thousands of online games , these isnt or person who cant fled atleast our game enjoyable . there are even games for educational fun that many kids love . with all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it ? all in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop , communicate , and find exciting entertainment . to be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that i find extravagant . it blows my mind to see and think , <caps> we can do this now , i wonder what we can accomplish in the future .\\n',\n",
       " 'in the <location> we have the technology of a computer . some say that the computers are good for the society . i disagree , i believe that it is bad for a few reasons . some of the reasons are obesity , cramps , more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying . first if people dont get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity . think of it this way , if you watch a kid that didnt have to go to school his entire life and he started off at <num> pounds . the only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight . next , tip-top-tip-top , thats all you hear when a kid is on the computer , <caps> teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and dont get off about on a school night . these are the kids that are <caps> likely to get bad cramps . they get the cramps form typing to fast , hard and too long . they also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but cant because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere . theres also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news , but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off . the reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didnt like it . this happens maybe close to <percent> of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online . this is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people . the last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying . cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead . have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid ? well , i have and its not nice , and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she <month> get cyberbullied because hes not smart enough or if he/she dont have the money to go to school . the cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online . there is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food . they <month> even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school . in conclusion , these are only a few ways that computers effects people . the obesity , cramps , sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and its not fun to get done to you . now its your turn to tell us what you think about the computers . do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with ?\\n',\n",

       " 'dear <organization> , the computer blinked to life and an image of a blonde haired girl filled the screen . it was easy to find out how life was in <location> , thanks to the actual <caps> girl explaining it . going to the library wouldnt have filled one with this priceless information and human interection . computers are a nessessity of life if soceity wishes to grow and expand . they should be supported because they teach hand eye coordination , give people the ability to learn about faraway places , and allow people to talk to others online . firstly , computers help teach hand eye coordination . hand-eye coordination is a useful ability that is usod to excel in sports . in a recent survey , <percent> of kids felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use . even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill . famous neurologist <caps> <person> stated in an article last week that , <caps> and computer strength the <caps> . when on the computer , you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands . <caps> hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball . if someone want to become better in these sports , all theyd need to do was turn on the computer . once people become better at sports , theyre more likely to play them and become more healthy . in reality , computers can help with exercising instead of decreasing it . additionaly , computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people . if someone wanted to reasearch <location> , all theyd need to do was type in a search would be presented to them in it would link forever to search through countless things . also , having the ability to learn about cultures can make peole peole and their cultures , they understand others something . increase tolerance people are . computers are a resourceful tool that they can help people in every different aspect of life . lastly , computer and in technology can allow people to chat . computer chat and video chat can help the all different nations . bring on good terms places other than can help us understand story comes out about something that happend in <location> , people can just go on their computer and ask an actual <location> citizen their take on the matter . also , video chat and online conversation can cut down on expensive phone bills . no one wants to pay more than they have to in this economy . another good point is that you can acess family members you scaresly visit . it can help you connect within your own family more . oviously , computers are a useful aid in todays era . their advancements push the world foreward to a better place . computers can help people because they help teach handeye coordination , give people the bility to learn about faraway places and people , and allow people to talk online with others . think of a world with no computers or technologicall advancements . the world would be sectored and unified , contact between people scare , and information even . the internet is like thousands or librarys put together . nobody would know much about other nations and news would travel slower . is that the kind of palce you want people to live in ?\\n',\n",
       " 'dear local newspaper , i belive that computers have a negative effect on peoples lives . i belive this because who spend to much time on the computer dont get out as much as they should , dont spend enough time with their family , and the computer cant do everything . my first reason is i belive that people need to get out more . when they dont get out , they dont exersise and that is very unhealthy . instead of watching the games or the scores they should get out and play the game . i also belive that they should enjoy nature because i feel like they are wasting the beauty of nature all around them . we wouldnt want to waste our abilities and privalges would we ? another reason is that they do not spend enough time with family . if you have family near you , then you should take advantage of that and interact with one another . you can have fun with your family by playing games . you can also have fun by just hanging out , which boost your social skills and the computer cant always do that , which brings me to my next point . the computer cant do everything , so take advantage of what you have now . some computer time is fine , but it can be very dangerous by getting addictted to it . the computer <month> have lots of information , but there is nothing that you cant find in a book . your computer cant love your dog , so there is a reason why we should get off the computer . there are pleanty of other things that you can do that you cant do on the computer , including sports , taking care of family , and any of your hobbys . remember that the computer <month> be great from time to time , but it can not live your life for you . that is why i belive that we should spend less time on the computer , and more time getting out , and having fun with family , and that the the computer cant do everything .\\n',\n",
       " 'dear local newspaper , i must admit that the experts are centainly right cause i know people that stay on the computer all day and thats really not good if you ask me . instead of being on computers learning about faraway places , and talking to other people , you should go exercising , you should relax , and you should interact with family and friends . exercising is much more better than being on a computer , and i say that to say this . when your on a computer just sitting there playing online games and checking other things out , or whatever the case <month> be , you get board , and hungry , and i know theres some snacks around you while your doing whatever your doing . instead of being on a computer for <num> or <num> hours or maybe even all day getting fat . there are many ways you can exercise . you can take walks , you can go joggin , you could play a sport , i mean there are a lot of things you can do when your not on a computer . i know some people that could be workin all day and still come home to there computer . rest is good also . you dont always have to jump on your computer , you could just relax watch a movie , eat some pop corn and just enjoy yourself , you could even take a nap for a little while or something but you dont always have to get straight on your computer if you really dont have to use it . the way i see it is family , and computers are always going to be there but at the same time which one is more important . friends arent always dependable so you really dont need them around only a selected few , but thats not the point . both family , and your true friends have feelings , and if your not spending time with them over a computer that your gonna have when you leave , and come back home too something isnt right . tomorrow isnt promised , we live for today . so enjoy life while you got the chance , and spend time doing something active , with family and friends , and if your really into computers , try to balance your time out .\\n',\n",

       " 'if the cat exists whether i see it or not , we can understand from our own experience how it gets hungry between one meal and the next ; but if it does not exist when i am not seeing it , it seems odd that appetite should grow during non-existence as fast as during existence .\\n',\n",

       " 'but the difficulty in the case of the cat is nothing compared to the difficulty in the case of human beings .\\n',\n",
       " 'when human beings speak -- that is , when we hear certain noises which we associate with ideas , and simultaneously see certain motions of lips and expressions of face -- it is very difficult to suppose that what we hear is not the expression of a thought , as we know it would be if we emitted the same sounds .\\n',\n",
       " 'of course similar things happen in dreams , where we are mistaken as to the existence of other people .\\n',\n",

       " 'we may therefore admit -- though with a slight doubt derived from dreams -- that the external world does really exist , and is not wholly dependent for its existence upon our continuing to perceive it .\\n',\n",
       " 'the argument which has led us to this conclusion is doubtless less strong than we could wish , but it is typical of many philosophical arguments , and it is therefore worth while to consider briefly its general character and validity .\\n',\n",
       " 'all knowledge , we find , must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs , and if these are rejected , nothing is left .\\n',\n",
       " 'but among our instinctive beliefs some are much stronger than others , while many have , by habit and association , become entangled with other beliefs , not really instinctive , but falsely supposed to be part of what is believed instinctively .\\n',\n",

       " 'this function , at least , philosophy can perform .\\n',\n",
       " 'most philosophers , rightly or wrongly , believe that philosophy can do much more than this -- that it can give us knowledge , not otherwise attainable , concerning the universe as a whole , and concerning the nature of ultimate reality .\\n',\n",
       " 'whether this be the case or not , the more modest function we have spoken of can certainly be performed by philosophy , and certainly suffices , for those who have once begun to doubt the adequacy of common sense , to justify the arduous and difficult labours that philosophical problems involve .\\n',\n",
       " 'that is to say , over and above the sensations of colour , hardness , noise , and so on , which make up the appearance of the table to me , i assume that there is something else , of which these things are appearances .\\n',\n",

       " 'on the contrary , i believe that it is because the table exists continuously that all these sense-data will reappear when i open my eyes , replace my arm , and begin again to rap with my knuckles .\\n',\n",
       " 'the question we have to consider in this chapter is : what is the nature of this real table , which persists independently of my perception of it ?\\n',\n",
       " 'to this question physical science gives an answer , somewhat incomplete it is true , and in part still very hypothetical , but yet deserving of respect so far as it goes .\\n',\n",
       " 'physical science , more or less unconsciously , has drifted into the view that all natural phenomena ought to be reduced to motions .\\n',\n",
       " 'light and heat and sound are all due to wave-motions , which travel from the body emitting them to the person who sees light or feels heat or hears sound .\\n',\n",

       " 'a wave-motion , on the contrary , could quite well be described to a blind man , since he can acquire a knowledge of space by the sense of touch ; and he can experience a wave-motion by a sea voyage almost as well as we can .\\n',\n",
       " 'now this something , which all of us who are not blind know , is not , according to science , really to be found in the outer world : it is something caused by the action of certain waves upon the eyes and nerves and brain of the person who sees the light .\\n',\n",
       " 'but light itself , the thing which seeing people experience and blind people do not , is not supposed by science to form any part of the world that is independent of us and our senses .\\n',\n",

       " \"these physical objects are in the space of science , which we may call 'physical ' space .\\n\",\n",
       " 'it is important to notice that , if our sensations are to be caused by physical objects , there must be a physical space containing these objects and our sense-organs and nerves and brain .\\n',\n",
       " 'we get a sensation of touch from an object when we are in contact with it ; that is to say , when some part of our body occupies a place in physical space quite close to the space occupied by the object .\\n',\n",
       " 'we see an object ( roughly speaking ) when no opaque body is between the object and our eyes in physical space .\\n',\n",
       " 'similarly , we only hear or smell or taste an object when we are sufficiently near to it , or when it touches the tongue , or has some suitable position in physical space relatively to our body .\\n',\n",
       " 'we can not begin to state what different sensations we shall derive from a given object under different circumstances unless we regard the object and our body as both in <num> physical space , for it is mainly the relative positions of the object and our body that determine what sensations we shall derive from the object .\\n',\n",
       " 'now our sense-data are situated in our private spaces , either the space of sight or the space of touch or such vaguer spaces as other senses may give us .\\n',\n",
       " 'if , as science and common sense assume , there is <num> public all-embracing physical space in which physical objects are , the relative positions of physical objects in physical space must more or less correspond to the relative positions of sense-data in our private spaces .\\n',\n",
       " 'there is no difficulty in supposing this to be the case .\\n',\n",

       " 'that is to say , we can know nothing of what it is like in itself , but we can know the sort of arrangement of physical objects which results from their spatial relations .\\n',\n",
       " 'we can know , for example , that the <location> and <location> and sun are in <num> straight line during an eclipse , though we can not know what a physical straight line is in itself , as we know the look of a straight line in our visual space .\\n',\n",
       " 'we can know all those things about physical space which a man born blind might know through other people about the space of sight ; but the kind of things which a man born blind could never know about the space of sight we also can not know about physical space .\\n',\n",
       " 'we can know the properties of the relations required to preserve the correspondence with sense-data , but we can not know the nature of the terms between which the relations hold .\\n',\n",
       " 'times when we are bored or suffering pain pass slowly , times when we are agreeably occupied pass quickly , and times when we are sleeping pass almost as if they did not exist .\\n',\n",
       " 'thus , in so far as time is constituted by duration , there is the same necessity for distinguishing a public and a private time as there was in the case of space .\\n',\n",
       " 'at any rate no reason can be given for supposing that the <num> orders are not the same .\\n',\n",
       " 'the same is usually true of space : if a regiment of men are marching along a road , the shape of the regiment will look different from different points of view , but the men will appear arranged in the same order from all points of view .\\n',\n",

       " \"the colour which an object seems to have at any given moment will in general be very similar , though not quite the same , from many different points of view ; we might thus suppose the 'real ' colour to be a sort of medium colour , intermediate between the various shades which appear from the different points of view .\\n\",\n",
       " 'such a theory is perhaps not capable of being definitely refuted , but it can be shown to be groundless .\\n',\n",
       " 'to begin with , it is plain that the colour we see depends only upon the nature of the light-waves that strike the eye , and is therefore modified by the medium intervening between us and the object , as well as by the manner in which light is reflected from the object in the direction of the eye .\\n',\n",
       " 'the intervening air alters colours unless it is perfectly clear , and any strong reflection will alter them completely .\\n',\n",

       " 'we shall understand by it the doctrine that whatever exists , or at any rate whatever can be known to exist , must be in some sense mental .\\n',\n",
       " 'this doctrine , which is very widely held among philosophers , has several forms , and is advocated on several different grounds .\\n',\n",
       " 'the doctrine is so widely held , and so interesting in itself , that even the briefest survey of philosophy must give some account of it .\\n',\n",
       " 'those who are unaccustomed to philosophical speculation may be inclined to dismiss such a doctrine as obviously absurd .\\n',\n",
       " 'there is no doubt that common sense regards tables and chairs and the sun and moon and material objects generally as something radically different from minds and the contents of minds , and as having an existence which might continue if minds ceased .\\n',\n",
       " 'we think of matter as having existed long before there were any minds , and it is hard to think of it as a mere product of mental activity .\\n',\n",
       " 'but whether true or false , idealism is not to be dismissed as obviously absurd .\\n',\n",
       " 'hence common sense leaves us completely in the dark as to the true intrinsic nature of physical objects , and if there were good reason to regard them as mental , we could not legitimately reject this opinion merely because it strikes us as strange .\\n',\n",
       " 'it may be unattainable , but if any philosopher believes that he has attained it , the fact that what he offers as the truth is strange ought not to be made a ground of objection to his opinion .\\n',\n",
       " 'the grounds on which idealism is advocated are generally grounds derived from the theory of knowledge , that is to say , from a discussion of the conditions which things must satisfy in order that we may be able to know them .\\n',\n",
       " 'the <num> serious attempt to establish idealism on such grounds was that of bishop berkeley .\\n',\n",
       " \"he proved <num> , by arguments which were largely valid , that our sense-data can not be supposed to have an existence independent of us , but must be , in part at least , 'in ' the mind , in the sense that their existence would not continue if there were no seeing or hearing or touching or smelling or tasting .\\n\",\n",
       " 'so far , his contention was almost certainly valid , even if some of his arguments were not so .\\n',\n",
       " \"but he went on to argue that sense-data were the only things of whose existence our perceptions could assure us ; and that to be known is to be 'in ' a mind , and therefore to be mental .\\n\",\n",
       " 'hence he concluded that nothing can ever be known except what is in some mind , and that whatever is known without being in my mind must be in some other mind .\\n',\n",
       " \"in order to understand his argument , it is necessary to understand his use of the word 'idea ' .\\n\",\n",
       " 'thus a particular colour which we see is an idea ; so is a voice which we hear , and so on .\\n',\n",
       " 'but the term is not wholly confined to sense-data .\\n',\n",
       " 'there will also be things remembered or imagined , for with such things also we have immediate acquaintance at the moment of remembering or imagining .\\n',\n",
       " \"all such immediate data he calls 'ideas ' .\\n\",\n",
       " 'he then proceeds to consider common objects , such as a tree , for instance .\\n',\n",
       " \"he shows that all we know immediately when we 'perceive ' the tree consists of ideas in his sense of the word , and he argues that there is not the slightest ground for supposing that there is anything real about the tree except what is perceived .\\n\",\n",
       " 'he fully admits that the tree must continue to exist even when we shut our eyes or when no human being is near it .\\n',\n",
       " \"but this continued existence , he says , is due to the fact that god continues to perceive it ; the 'real ' tree , which corresponds to what we called the physical object , consists of ideas in the mind of god , ideas more or less like those we have when we see the tree , but differing in the fact that they are permanent in god 's mind so long as the tree continues to exist .\\n\",\n",
       " \"all our perceptions , according to him , consist in a partial participation in god 's perceptions , and it is because of this participation that different people see more or less the same tree .\\n\",\n",
       " 'thus apart from minds and their ideas there is nothing in the world , nor is it possible that anything else should ever be known , since whatever is known is necessarily an idea .\\n',\n",

       " \"in the <num> place , there is a confusion engendered by the use of the word 'idea ' .\\n\",\n",
       " \"we think of an idea as essentially something in somebody 's mind , and thus when we are told that a tree consists entirely of ideas , it is natural to suppose that , if so , the tree must be entirely in minds .\\n\",\n",

       " 'this confusion may seem too gross to have been really committed by any competent philosopher , but various attendant circumstances rendered it possible .\\n',\n",
       " 'in order to see how it was possible , we must go more deeply into the question as to the nature of ideas .\\n',\n",
       " 'before taking up the general question of the nature of ideas , we must disentangle <num> entirely separate questions which arise concerning sense-data and physical objects .\\n',\n",

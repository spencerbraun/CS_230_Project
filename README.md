# sophisticated_style_transfer

This is the main code repository for the paper Generative Text Style Transfer for Improved Language Sophistication.

For code corresponding to the Style Transfer model, see https://github.com/spencerbraun/style-transformer, a forked project from https://github.com/fastnlp/style-transformer

For code corresponding to the ARAE model, see https://github.com/spencerbraun/ARAE, a forked project from https://github.com/jakezhaojb/ARAE

### Data Processing
All data processing manipulations are performed in the "Data Processing.ipynb" file. Raw ASAP data can be found in data/raw, while the processed data used to train the models can be found in data/processed. All other data is generated in the data processing notebook.

### Evaluation
The evaluation metrics found in the paper along with others tested can be found in Evaluation.ipynb

### Research
The research folder contains notes on relevant literature, evaluation metrics, as well as experiments run with different autoencoder models.

i was sadly mistaken .
so on to the hoagies , the italian is general run of the mill .
minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce .
nothing really special & not worthy of the $ _num_ price tag .
second , the steak hoagie , it is atrocious .
i had to pay $ _num_ to add cheese to the hoagie .
she told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side .
are you kidding me ?
i was not going to pay for the dressing on the side .
i ordered it without lettuce , tomato , onions , or dressing .
are you kidding me ?
i paid $ _num_ to add sauted mushrooms , onions , and cheese .
in this case , never .
( the hoagie bun was better than average . )
wake up or you are going to lose your business .
this place has none of them .
it is april and there are no grass tees yet .
there is no grass on the range .
bottom line , this place sucks .
someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be .
very disappointed in the customer service .
we will not be back .
the iced tea is also terrible tasting .
used to go there for tires , brakes , etc .
plus , _num_ of the new tires went flat within _num_ weeks .
terrible .
i was originally told it would take _num_ mins .
slow , over priced , i 'll go elsewhere next time .
so frustrated .
never going back .
they seem overpriced , too .
do n't waste your time .
not a call , not the estimate , nothing .
shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like .
she was very uncomfortable .
at this point they were open and would be for another hour .
wait _num_ hrs .
she has to wait _num_ days to be seen .
absolutely the worst care in all my experience with vets !
this place went from great to horrible .
absolutely no problems .
noisy snow tires in the summer !
i told him they are too noisy .
very rude and once they get paid have no ethics .
i dropped off _num_ shirts at this establishment just before thanksgiving .
they have offered $ _num_ a shirt for the shirts they lost .
i would n't use their services again if you paid me to .
sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed .
bread or not , it still was n't great .
it was a basic salad , no big deal .
i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be .
nah ... why bother when there are so many other options around .
just do n't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds .
but apparently , mama has left the kitchen .
as for my mushroom and cheese omelette , the cheese was lacking .
if i wanted a microwave omelet i would have gone to burger king .
two scrambled whole eggs , italian toast , and home fries .
in a considerably nasty tone .
trash .
guess who was n't too busy , carnegie coffee company down the street .
nothing special .
it was hot in there and i do n't think they have ac .
it does n't say cash only anywhere inside or on the menu either .
there is an atm , but it has a $ _num_ charge to use .
ca n't believe a place in _num_ does n't take cards .
the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate .
i fed my whole family breakfast ( _num_ of us ) for $ _num_ .
not to mention my allergies were in full effect .
the bathroom was so inconvenient to get in and out of .
breakfast was pathetic .
i 'll be sure to spend my money elsewhere next time .
if i could give this place less than one star , i would .
apparently , we were out of luck .
it 's a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs .
no more smoking allowed .
same lousy service .
i really really want this place to do better .
we need more irish pubs and local old time watering holes .
whatever the case , they have cold guinness .
some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .
we used a coupon from the paper for a _num_ topping _num_ cut sicilian .
the onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can .
it was gross .
the veggies were old and wilted , and there was no dressing on either .
no flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam .
i have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed .
what a mistake .
the business is not run the way it has been in the past .
this is probably the worst business in carnegie .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
the inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for .
it smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door .
the fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft .
the corn lacked butter .
service was n't too bad - nice people .
unfortunately , there are only two reviews .
they did not acknowledge me .
the door i was at had signage ( open hours ) .
take it from me ; avoid this place at all cost .
does n't even taste good as american style chinese food .
i used to order takeout here once every month or so .
let alone one that the food is n't even that good .
also the inside is dirty as heck .
needless to say , we never returned .
otherwise i 'll have to have him put to sleep .
do n't take your cat here .
do n't waste your time or money at this denny 's .
i never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members .
i did n't feel welcome here .
but it 's not well maintained .
terrible service .
but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit .
but it was n't just the knowledge of the menu .
there was no one filling up water .
my biggest complaint , however , is what happened with our meals .
so , he took the meals back to the kitchen .
they did n't remake anything .
quite frankly , the fish was n't good at all .
the guy never really even apologized for the mistake .
coming here you get the feeling they have n't changed much .
does that make you a little worried ?
ambiance , like i said , left much to be desired .
consider where this place is , the prices are really really high .
nothing is served on the side with main dishes ... .
papa j 's is expensive and inconsistent .
there are better restaurants in carnegie .
it was so disgusting i could n't eat it .
ugh .
not a ton of flavor there either .
his broccoli was rock hard - like wood !
and the chicken was very dry .
i have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times .
i wo n't go back .
the first time we were there almost _num_ hours .
ridiculous .
if it were up to me i would have never returned .
unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight .
my food was cold and bland , my kids food was cold .
bad food , slow service and rude managers .
papa j 's is no longer the only game in town .
obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management .
appalling !
my husband & i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time .
my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar .
my husband 's pasta had even less flavor than mine .
we ate about a quarter of the food & could n't even finish it .
and i hate wasting food !
do n't waste your time eating here .
there are much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh .
well , papa j 's has officially priced itself out of our budget .
$ _num_ per salad ?
it 's lettuce , cheese , and pine nuts !
$ _num_ / salad ?
our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty .
we are not going back .
it rather looks like a deli counter .
a bit confusing layout , but tastefully done .
the dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant .
there was no salad or pasta side offered .
this alone i would have given _num_ stars .
annoying ?
confused ?
he appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time .
however , i think i would try somewhere else to dine .
why the hell was there a wait ?
the older man that took us to the table could have done nicer .
the food was not bad but it was not good .
the chicken piccata was flavorful , but not as expected .
it had no signs of being coated and sauted to a rich golden brown .
no pasta was served with the chicken .
the side of vegetables were well cooked , buy again lacked any real flavor .
the total was $ _num_ and change .
my friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage .
the waitress was extremely rude .
too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude !
that is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst .
we sat for _num_ minutes before a server came to our table .
at that point , she said i 'll grab you water and bread .
however , we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold .
we also ordered the `` incredible white pizza '' which was incredibly cold .
while patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible .
also , i wrote to the restaurant and received no response .
for $ _num_ a person it was terrible .
i got the shrimp and veal and my veal was dry .
i ordered a drink _num_ times and never got it .
i 'll probably never go back again .
worst service of all time .
place is a total joke .
the last visit i overlooked the $ _num_ gnocchi special .
okay , shame on us for not asking .
potatoes or pasta are always included with marsala .
never ever again will we return here .
not us .
just so rude .
the worst dental experience of my life .
i have never been so uncomfortable in my life .
save yourself a lot of time , money and pain .
no one should have to go thru what i am currently going thru .
the worst dental office i ever been .
you should avoid it at any time .
would not have my dogs teeth cleaned here !
this place is one of the worst dental offices i 've ever walked into .
i 've never posted a yelp review before .
no sign of italian meat to be found .
no marinara sauce .
you may want to consider having the pizza delivered .
my expectations for mcdonalds are t rarely high .
the cashier took my friends 's order , then promptly ignored me .
the manager was rude when giving me my order .
i 've eaten at various mcdonalds restaurants for over _num_ years .
this mcdonald 's is so bad it 's amazing .
order : big mac , large fries , diet coke .
the soda machine was broken .
no sodas .
left with : big mac , medium fries , no coke .
there 's nothing to see here .
poor customer service .
worst mcdonalds i have ever been to .
last time i went chicken nuggets were under cooked .
people were getting refunds wait time was so long .
soda is watered down and gross .
rude staff doesnt know what they are doing .
just skip this one and you will be better off .
seating inside is very limited .
i 'm not a huge fan of this location .
and there 's hardly any tables to sit at .
this has never happened before and it took me off guard .
the barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push .
i will avoid this one at the waterfront for awhile .
with all of the other options in the area , take your money elsewhere !
finally , i find one after _num_ minutes of wondering around .
this is not the first time i 've been hard up to find help .
the store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere .
however , if you 're looking for something specific , good luck .
i usually only stop there if i 'm already at tend waterfront .
not at this location .
this is the absolute worst steak n shake i 've ever been to .
the bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for _num_ min .
wish i had looked it up earlier .
the only thing worse than the food is the service .
there were several things that got me annoyed , one after another .
but the food came cold .
we were so hungry by that point , we just ate whatever we could .
neither angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even once .
might have been a stomach bug but it is kind of strange .
terrible wait staff could n't even seat us .
def not worth the wait .
i really like the chili .
burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad .
pretty hard to mess up a side salad .
as others have said you never know what kind of service you will get .
store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair .
cheap and crap service .
unfortunately the service is very hit or miss .
the service is awful .
the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service .
i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared .
it was all i could taste .
tonight they told me that the drive thru was closed .
i have never , ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom .
this one , however , leaves a lot to be desired .
most of the time , they 're downright rude .
dirty and slow .
this location is terrible .
the drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food .
she then told me it only comes with cheese .
so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger .
the meat is badly burned and cold .
it was clear to me this burger was not fresh .
the service is the worst i 've ever seen .
i do n't know how corporate keeps this place open .
i 've complained numerous times but it never does any good .
take the extra _num_ minutes to drive to the south hills location .
food is cheap but portions are small .
also the restaurant is not really clean either .
this restaurant is not my number _num_ choice .
i really do n't know how this place stays open .
on our last visit it took us _num_ minutes to get our waitresses attention .
it took _num_ minutes to get the mustard and mayo .
just bad service .
our waitress was very polite , though .
i have eaten here before and never had any problems .
they completely ignored us so we got up and left .
one table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention .
slow service .
food is very cheap though .
i would go here if the service was faster and better .
slow .
still no food .
we were a party of _num_ adults and _num_ kid .
i 've worked at steak n shake before .
it less than _num_ minutes to cook both the burgers and fries .
the manager here needs better training .
i waited _num_ minutes for charred hamburger .
however they ( waitresses ) were nice and apologetic .
could n't believe the waitress thought it was okay to serve .
waitress was rude to them and the manager never came to address the issue .
terrible customer service .
five guy burgers much better .
this is the worst place i 've maybe ever been to .
the outside was filthy with trash all over .
the inside was maybe worse , trash and dirty .
the employees were awful , rude , slow and not caring about a thing .
i ca n't even guess how unsanitary it might be .
disgusting .
i keep forgetting how not good this location is .
i only returned because i was getting my dog groomed at the nearby petco .
actually there was nothing basement like about it .
what will be done with the empty space that is the question ?
$ _num_ for a red bull and vodka ?
in my opinion , sing sing is really not worth it .
lame .
lame as heck .
the music the guys played was all stuff from like _num_ .
i would not recommend anybody go .
this place has gone significantly down hill .
however , each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller .
very slow and boring .
save your $ _num_ and skip this place .
we had reservations , which was good because it was packed that saturday night .
why should it , those computers are always making mistakes .
what was originally an average lowe 's has turned into lowe 's hell .
we would be paying several hundred dollars to get the doors installed .
after the installation , lowe 's would refund us the $ _num_ .
i told him we would like our $ _num_ back .
i can not believe how unprofessional this store was !
goodbye lowes ... hello home depot !
what a shame !
so much rudeness -- checking out and trying to find other items .
clearly there are zero expectations for customer service here .
our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that .
the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing .
if you are going to order something , i would go with the pizza .
we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good , also .
she sent it back .
no quick and easy app or beers on the house .
to boot , the beer was pretty expensive .
the biggest downfall of duke 's , though , is the food .
the first was flavorless and cold .
the second was passable , but nothing special .
and the last were absolutely awful .
i ate two of the _num_ tenders ( seven ! )
_num_ strikes .
i gave up and refused the offer for another .
i felt bad just ordering free beer so i ordered a sandwich .
bar staff not so much this visit .
we were ignored until i grabbed a table in the back .
neither of us were n't very happy about this .
menus for drinks and food have no prices .
$ _num_ for a banana split cocktail ?
waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts .
trying to get something healthy , i ordered the apple pecan salad .
i could barely eat the salad .
perhaps next time we 'll just stop by for drinks instead .
i guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene .
the food was absolutely gross !
first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread ( lame ) !
gross !
mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location .
the food is crap .
this time , it was ridiculous .
on top of that , the customer service sucked .
for $ _num_ , it was n't worth it .
mediocre service .
cold food !
our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted .
bland food .
_num_ beer per hour maximum .
avoid at all costs .
here 's where it gets bad .
_num_ mins later we get our refills .
mind you , our food still has n't came yet .
i was frustrated .
finally , _num_ mins later ... that 's one hour , folks .
yep , the food was cold .
the only compensation we got were $ _num_ game cards .
waitress never apologized .
after spending over $ _num_ plus games , we will never go back .
it was a saturday !
_num_ bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full .
all i have to say is get your crap together .
for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends .
apathetic service staff all around , the peanut and i were really disappointed .
wo n't be back .
let me tell you about my bad experience first .
what the hell !
i was just really turned off from that experience .
lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people !
i will not be back again to eat .
the outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste .
the fish itself was bland .
i was thinking he would have stopped but did n't oh well .
sometime you just get one that is n't .
this place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms .
when our food came though , everything was below average .
did n't see a manager until after 10:30 pm .
needless to say , we did n't stay to eat and went elsewhere .
it 's the customers fault your staff ca n't handle a sat night rush .
i will never spend money here again !
awful awful .
took _num_ minutes to even be acknowledged .
wrong !
first off , service was horrible .
it took about _num_ minutes , minimum , to get our first drinks .
my boyfriend had their philly cheesesteak and he could n't finish it .
was so salty and just not good .
for the price of everything , it was not worth it all .
you 'll save $ $ , time , and frustration !
everything was pretty picked over , which kinda sucked .
so we again go off in search of someone to help .
it also was n't the cleanest place i 've ever seen .
and not well maintained or managed at all .
over priced , over hyped but a hell of a time regardless .
i ate here for lunch today with my wife and _num_ kids .
server was prompt getting to the table , took our order and then disappeared .
grilled cheese , salad and a quesadilla should n't take that long .
mens room did n't have any paper towels to dry hands with .
huge fail for this type of venue .
service is n't too bad , but could be better .
i also thing d & b is n't the cleanest place either .
the bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion .
does n't seem like they keep up with it .
to me , thats a big factor in rating restaurants .
this was n't the cleanest place .
dirty paper towels all over the women 's bathroom .
also they are n't following corporate policy .
very disappointed in his attitude more then anything .
the food here is awful .
i only gave it _num_ stars because i liked my mac and cheese .
everyone else at the table hated their food .
all i have to say is no thanks .
i 'd hate to be there when they are `` busy '' .
worst service i 've ever had !
we left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food .
no apologies nothing .
while sitting there we noticed _num_ other parties walked out as well .
they did n't even get their drinks .
i would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat .
the food was bad .
the bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky .
the waitress was nice but overall i would n't dine here again .
if you are under _num_ you must be accompanied by a _num_ year old .
awful place with rude people .
this place has really gone down hill in the past 3-4 years .
we will not be going back !
if you are here to eat , maybe try somewhere else .
even managers saw us sitting there and didnt bother to greet us .
we will still go here just not try to eat .
i am _num_ and my sisters are younger than i am .
which i was , and i was not allowed in .
avoid eating or drinking anything here .
the service was terrible .
especially multiple employees , hostesses , waitresses , and bus boys .
either way , on a saturday night , i would n't recommend going here .
nina the manager and ashley the cashier extremely rude .
highly recommend that no one ever goes here .
our service was awful as well .
i do n't think i have one good thing to say about this place .
she brought a pile of beverage napkins .
but that 's not the worst .
despite pointing out the problem , she never did do anything about that .
anyway , do n't try to eat here .
just come and play the games , but skip the food .
i wish there were no kids .
she was definitely old enough to understand why she was wrong .
how ridiculous for an arcade game company to turn away kids .
if they had a negative star would have selected the worst rating .
_num_ hour wait and then cold food served .
did not have enough staff in kitchen and never bothered to provide updates .
nothing positive to say other than do n't go there .
ghetto , the server kept calling me baby all night .
staff is rude .
waited _num_ minutes for our drinks and an additional _num_ minutes for our food .
i could understand if they were busy , but it was n't at all .
the food was n't very good at all .
i 've never sent back food , ever , but this was ridiculous .
the server takes my plate , and says they would make it right .
ca n't say much for an office that is managed this way .
the lack of empathy was even more disturbing .
do n't take it out on the person they are incorrectly calling .
the frosty is never frosty always runny .
`` nah '' it was _num_ .
guess not .
cant rate the food cause i have n't received any .
but since its _num_ guess they are closed .
if there was a way to give no stars i would .
horrible service .
so we called back and asked for our money back .
if you want terrible pizza go here .
not worth one star !
- original pretzel appetizer .
the half order of ribs looked like a full rack .
- lots of food choices ... burgers ... steak ... chicken ... salads .
lots of drink choices ... beers ... wines ... mixed drinks .
- none of the food was super awesome .
nothing was awful , but nothing stood out in any way .
- kind of dead on a monday night with 3/4 of the place empty .
head next door to sing sing for drinks , though .
the low point lately has been the food .
unfortunately rock bottom is one that falls into that category .
it 's pretty much a crap shoot .
unfortunately , it seems there is zero attention to food quality .
till then , it 's hit or miss !
i must admit , i do like the brews .
i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes .
other than that , meh .
the food is pretty forgettable .
not worth $ _num_ unfortunately the sausage platter was $ _num_ .
the restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table .
i have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable .
their food is pretty much like their beers , forgettable .
here 's where i ran into problems .
it was very greasy and had virtually no crab .
the service was ok , not the best not the worst .
if i was n't so hungry i would n't have eaten them at all !
the husband had the bbq chicken pizza .
it blew my crappy tacos out of the water !
and the underwhelming food sealed the deal .
poor service and food .
i waited _num_ minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence .
so i had to wait an additional _num_ minutes to find someone to pay .
on to the important part ... food was terrible .
i had a burger and it was pathetic .
otherwise , you are better off skipping it .
unfortunately the reality did n't match the idea of the burger .
it was like having a standard old boring burger .
i was very disappointed .
for $ _num_ , i would have expected a lot more flavor .
but yes , you guessed it , that 's overpriced too .
the food was uninspired , tired , and ordinary .
spicy and thick it went down easy enough .
the steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of ... .
not the best dinner they have eaten .
it was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon .
over all this meal was a wash .
corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck .
the service has also suffered tremendously .
i do n't expect this rock bottom to be around too much longer .
i could not even finish half of mine .
if i were to go back , it certainly would not be to eat .
meh is the only thing i leave here feeling .
i ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me .
it was topped with an olive and a mini pickle ... odd .
my `` squash '' side was lacking squash .
instead all squash was replaced by peppers ... which i can not eat .
very disappointing menu .
i 'm very disappointed to say this place has gone down hill .
every time we are seated in the dining area it 's a bad experience .
i tried to steal a few of his fries , which were a failure .
on my own dish i had the classic mac n ' chicken .
and when i say smothered here , this is not a good thing .
everything else , avoid .
first bad experience at this place .
double swiss burger was as tasteless as they could make .
i asked for medium cooked and they gave me burnt .
instead of caramelized onions , they added raw onions .
the waiter did not even bother to ask if everything was okay .
wo n't visit again .
overall , it was a mediocre experience with forgettable food .
i wo n't be going back .
my boyfriend 's bison burger was not that tasty either he sent it back .
very disappointed with this place .
do not come here to eat .
_num_ stars because the beer was good .
no salsa , no lettuce , guac , sour cream .
it was so underwhelming .
i wish the food could match the quality of their beer .
if you want rock bottom food , head to rock bottom .
slow service , horrible , horrible food .
was served freezing cold enchiladas and pizza .
terrible customer service , disrespectful in fact .
never going back again and i would advise against master muffler to all others .
second , the sodas are not free refills !
but the biggest problem is the food and drink .
_num_ - a lot of the drinks did n't have prices on them .
it 's not that hard .
_num_ - put the drink prices on the website too .
not all the prices are on the website , which makes for difficult planning .
the food , however , is mediocre at best .
i could not see a thing .
it was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl .
it looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked .
it was n't edible .
it does n't even have to be memorable ... just not offensive .
but damn , i was hungry !
i feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole .
i 'd give the comedians _num_ stars , and the food zero stars .
no , i do n't want you to take our food back !
is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on ?
sadly , no .
the service did n't get any better .
the food was lousy .
one of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich .
but hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable .
we also sent an order of chicken fingers back ... dryer than sand .
overpriced , shitty food and drinks .
hell , tgi friday 's would have been better .
they did n't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready .
seating is first come , first served .
whoever designed this place should be shot .
there is no lobby to hold people before a show .
there is no question that it has everything you could want .
that 's where the praise ends .
and it 's not just coffee , and not just target .
they 're banking on this lack of competition .
now , maybe you do n't care .
they clearly do n't bring them in at the end of the night .
the lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious .
walmart does n't even make you do that !
this was an expensive skirt , completely ruined .
very disappointed .
just do n't take your dry cleaning here .
costco was closed so i went to giant eagle .
do n't waste your time , or risk your health .
go to any other pharmacy in town , avoid giant eagle .
went to barnes and noble waterfront with _num_ books on my list .
it 's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows .
i do n't remember her name which is usually not a good sign .
rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders .
so , i settled on the hummus appetizer .
all in all this place is n't that bad .
drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow .
thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back .
bar louie : you are dead to me .
the place was near empty and there were three waitresses .
_num_ minutes later , our food and the bill arrived .
worst part ?
however , i gave this place two stars instead of one .
let me just say that this used to be a place i loved .
i ca n't say the food is bad .
i will say i still ate them so shame on me .
there were fruit flies everywhere .
because of number two our service in general was not good .
the _num_ of us got to bar louie at 8:30 .
i wo n't be going back .
i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first .
outside of that bar louie leaves a lot to be desired .
to me , that is beyond ridiculous .
the absolute worst service i have ever had at any bar or restaraunt .
and , in looking at other reviews , i am not the first .
it was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing .
servers are chatting , not paying attention to tables .
worst serves ever .
it 's expensive , the food is so so .
skip it .
there were also plenty of empty tables .
this should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction .
the server was nice , that is not the issue .
the issue was how grossly understaffed they were .
our server , was friendly .
my husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me .
both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol .
awful acoustics !
bobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar .
maybe i 'm just salty about the wait .
not even a large one , either !
but good lord , they 're just so loud !
i always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard .
not cool , bar louie .
not cool .
food was _num_ out of _num_ for this type of bar / restaurant .
service was extremely poor and bar service was also extremely poor .
_num_ mins .
i wan na love bar louie , i do .
dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature .
the service is ok but rather slow .
he immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks .
only another _num_ minutes until he brought one martini over .
we originally sat upstairs , which was open per the sign .
the one other time that i had been there the service was so-so .
this is not one of them .
was seated for _num_ min and no wait staff came to take our order .
awkward .
the only other bartender was slowly walking around the other end of the bar .
we got up and walked out and will never be back .
worst bar i have ever been to .
she then disappeared for _num_ minutes before coming back to take a food order .
there is no excuse for the poor service and food .
the worst bar and the worst service in the area .
if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
please ... take your hard earned money elsewhere .
sat at the bar at about _num_ saturday for appetizers and drinks .
no offer to refill drinks or for water .
i made a reservation for _num_ on a saturday night .
the manager was rude .
nothing to rave about .
it was just ordinary .
all in all , this place just needs a bit of organization .
terrible service .
small flies flying around restaurant .
mortified by this , my wife and i quickly finished and left .
the drinks are very expensive but that 's every bar louie .
i spent almost _num_ minutes for some nachos .
skip this place if you do n't want to feel ill after dining .
you will have to spend $ _num_ on a parking pass .
there are just too many misses in my book though .
he pushed me and took all the chairs .
an adult area would change all this .
the weekdays are bad enough .
i 'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer .
the lazy river could be much better .
dont waste your time with this place .
long lines , overpriced and no shade or cooling spots while you wait .
you 're better off with a garden hose .
disgusted .
just sad there customer service sucks .
my sister for a deal for _num_ and day in the _num_ season .
i paid _num_ at my local giant eagle .
thats not really a big deal .
that is a downfall .
we did n't do the lay river however because the lines were ridiculous .
people are rude there as well .
some horse play and such .
$ _num_ locker .
i really hate this place .
all of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go .
just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong .
so after several more wrong turns we finally get home .
absolutely terrible night .
otherwise , i would suggest staying far , far away !
please do n't eat this food .
fried rice super bland .
chicken was slimy .
service was indifferent .
no repeat visit for me .
rice is a little plain but i just add some soy sauce .
general tso had no flavor .
not crispy at all assuming thats why it was so fast .
only reason i would go back is speed .
meh , i 've experienced better is an understatement .
somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why .
i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard .
waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks .
disappointment .
so sad .
i order the jack daniel 's chicken and shrimp with just fries .
the chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer .
even the water tasted weird .
nothing special just around average !
went with _num_ others for a weeknight dinner .
i ordered a burger , which very overdone and dry .
the place was pretty dead and we were seated right away .
fridays seems to have gone down hill .
my burger was well done and dry .
i was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone .
the wait staff did n't even acknowledge our party of _num_ .
my experience at this friday 's was not what i was expecting .
this beer is like champaign and it makes my whole stomach nice and cold .
why was my beer warm ?
better than that , why was my pot sticker appetizer in my beer ?
i did not find this funny at all !
i really do n't know why i bother with chain restaurants anymore .
when the salad arrived , it did not look like the picture .
it was disgusting .
not only was it disgusting , but it cost us about $ _num_ .
it was ok ... very mediocre .
i 'm sure there 's still a lot of room for improvement , however .
avoid this place !
i really never want to return .
food was ok had a steak w/ shrimp side ass mashed potatoes .
the menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive .
but later the service was not all good .
bad bad service .
was very disappointed with the food .
how does this place still exist of every place on the waterfront !
possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is .
service was just barely adequate on this visit .
it sure is n't the food .
too much dressing in a salad that did n't even fill the bowl .
only in a pinch .
ca n't handle basic cleanliness then this is not a place to eat at .
we woke up late and missed the breakfast hours of our favorite place .
it was around 11:30 and the restaurant was mostly empty .
it was ok but not something i would order again .
my husband 's salad , italian chopped , was better .
it had huge chunks of tomatoes , sausage , and cheese .
for something that took so long to get it should have been hot .
i managed one bite and was done .
what we came away with from this experience is to leave .
do n't try to stay when the experience is that bad .
interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already .
i understand , you ca n't try them all .
no one .
um , i 'm not asking you to help me sort things .
i 'm not holding up a line .
i have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before .
i have never visited a store with such a bad staff .
i hate this place .
our drinks and my soup came out immediately .
i did n't know what it was and did n't want to know .
i ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server .
it was thick and gooey and the flavor did n't wow .
i saw no reason to continue .
the skins were a bit thick and doughy .
we finished our dumplings .
this food , though , it was n't good .
i just do n't understand how anyone can like this place .
we tried going early , late -- it never made any difference .
the front staff was rude , and the wait was too long .
they could n't tell us when we would be seated .
after _num_ minutes we gave up .
i had the singapore rice noodles .
the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw .
sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick .
the service was annoying .
there 's nothing really wrong with it .
the food is sooooo bland though .
last time we were there the server was horrendous as well .
it was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died .
but it 's soooooo bland !
they were also playing _num_ year old pop music really loud .
come on -- this is an `` asian bistro . ''
i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation .
our party arrived about _num_ minutes before our 5:30 reservations .
however it was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck .
i get there , look at their giant selection and get excited .
we sat at the bar and the female bartender was miserable .
we ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did .
do not sit by the windows because it was very cold .
nothing was comped and no manager was available .
this pf changs needs new management !
it 's not worth the headache .
drinks were not good .
below par on every way .
the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door .
did n't say a word to us .
will not be back there -- rude hostess !
it 's fake asian food .
terrible experience !
very bad experience .
i started with a cup of their wonton soup .
on a scale of bad to good , it was kind of meh .
none at all .
never going back to pf changs .
the only thing this place has going for itself is the decor .
the service was not that professional !
the service was terrible .
we waited almost _num_ minutes for water glasses to be brought to the table .
when my dish comes out , it 's literally just steamed veggies and rice .
no tofu , no seasoning or sauce .
not going back .
not going to recommend it to anyone .
disappointing : ( i expected more out of pf chang 's .
would n't go back .
i you want chinese go to how lee , or china palace .
if i had to use one word to describe my experience : depressing .
when we got to the table , we were hoping for a better experience .
there were no complaints with the chicken , the only star of this evening .
the beef was disappointing to say the very least .
my only regret is i can not leave a 1/2 star rating .
it was bitter cold outside .
i asked our server why they had n't mentioned this when we came in .
i quickly ate and left to make my movie .
this is the second bad experience i 've had at this particular location .
i 'm not against p.f .
chicken was very tough .
my boyfriend ordered the hot fish , but it was way too salty .
not much more , but enough to make it not right .
instead , my total was about $ _num_ .
bottom line , enterprise ca n't be trusted .
not at this location , at least .
i 've had bad experiences here a few times now .
bad service all around !
really , you do n't get much for what you pay for at panera .
its not very good at all .
service here is pretty bad .
i ordered chicken tortellini pasta and chicken noodle soup .
panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant i have ever been to .
it did not even look appetizing .
stopped by sunday morning .
the light roast coffee was cold .
the steak was ice cold .
the slice of tomato that i had them add was not ripe .
panera quality should be consistent no matter what location you visit .
very disappointing considering their pricing structure .
do not eat the pastries !
yuk , i said that 's disgusting people have to eat that .
she reluctantly gave me the owners name .
service here has gone considerably downhill .
needless to say , will be my last time going there .
i just felt i was rushed out of there .
am i the only one ?
target reminds me of hills when i was a kid .
my experience here was not great at all .
watch out when it looks like something is on sale .
white slim fit shirt looked ridiculous .
his jacket did n't fit and his white shirt was worse than mine .
he said , oh about $ _num_ or $ _num_ .
i 'm shocked , never thought men 's dress clothes were so pricey .
first of all , the store was messy .
okay , i get it , they work on commission , but seriously .
needless to say , she would n't leave us alone .
my husband said , i 'm looking for some dress shirts and pants .
if it would have been me alone , i would have walked out .
however , i knew my husband wanted to use the gift card .
i did n't get it .
continuing on , check out was a nightmare !
worst customer service .
it 's not that delish .
this store has such bad service .
the service staff are rude rude rude .
save your money , shop elsewhere .
i love bbb ; however , this location is terrible .
maybe they should pay me for this responsibility .
my gut just tells me not to trust e 'n ps .
so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff .
strawberry pies being the exception to the rule .
there are better places to eat for the same money .
ugh .
it seemed like every single employee was around _num_ years old .
the service was very slow .
my drink was never refilled .
basically the whole experience was pure torture , which is disappointing .
being next door to corporate you would have higher expectations .
the breakfast bar is lame .
the pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a _num_ year old .
if i remembered her name , i would definitely mention it in this review .
it 's a hit and miss .
this location though has horribly slow service .
it 's not .
does n't matter what time we go .
get your hosts and servers on the same page !
poor service from the door .
i walked in and was ignored .
possibly the worst dining experience i 've had .
no apology .
she simply said that sometimes they are n't told when someone is seated outside .
extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it .
this has to be the worst restaurant at the waterfront .
it is appalling to see what that place has become .
i will never go back to that place again .
unfortunately , that was the high point of this service .
the waitress there are extremely rude .
good cheap food .
horrible service .
had to wait _num_ minutes before our waiter to even acknowledge us .
he then was really rude and never gave us napkins or forks .
did n't get any refills .
the coffee was stale .
i recently went into this eat n park and had a horrible experience .
how can a restaurant not have proper seating for its paying customers ?
trying to eat `` fresh '' pineapple with no wine just breaks my heart .
much closer to bland than anything .
the meat was extremely bland , with very little seasoning .
i talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side .
i was highly disappointed in the service , and i only ordered take out .
no offer of water , or a drink .
_num_ staff members yelled .
she then rings me up .
when i go to eat my meal , utensils were not included .
very disappointing experience .
will not be returning .
not good .
not good .
this appetizer was recommended and was garbage .
why _num_ star ?
went there last night about 5:30 , the place was maybe half full .
sorry but not going back there again .
the service was mostly friendly but i was disappointed in my meal .
my meal was way over cooked .
had lobster bisque soup not to good .
the scallops were hard , over cooked .
shrimp had no flavor .
it took so long to get , we just left .
whoever gave this place _num_ or five stars must be out of their minds .
bad decision .
the chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes .
the crab cakes were definitely frozen , and not made from blue crab .
zero flavor and dry as hell .
stringy , asian crab that was definitely pre-made .
terrible .
very disappointing easter dinner .
five minutes later the $ _num_ easter special came out .
he was very rude to us .
his poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday .
however , the service we experienced was terrible .
good food , but i wo n't be in a hurry to go back .
first time in pittsburgh on biz and staying in the waterfront district .
too many other good choices nearby to give them a second chance - sorry .
disappointed .
i gave it twice and no one bothered to contact me .
stay far away from this place .
what a disappointing easter dinner .
five minutes later the $ _num_ easter special came out .
he was very rude to us .
his poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday .
very disappointing .
the restaurant was about half full , i was with one other person .
chef 's special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp .
it also was served at room temperature .
i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables .
the garnish had cheese on it the first time , not the 2nd .
penne was mediocre at best .
service -- - probably the worst service i 've ever had there .
never did get a refill on iced tea .
sorry to see this place go down hill .
may not ever go back .
will not eat here again .
party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something .
it was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste .
